Pure Python bindings for the pure C++11/OpenCL Qrack quantum computer simulator library

(**PyQrack** is just pure Qrack.)

**IMPORTANT**: You must build and install [vm6502q/qrack](https://github.com/vm6502q/qrack) to use this `main` branch. The `pypi_package` branch, however, comes with pre-compiled Qrack binaries, and that is the form published on PyPi.

Import and instantiate [`QrackSimulator`](https://github.com/vm6502q/pyqrack/blob/main/pyqrack/qrack_simulator.py) instances. This simulator can perform arbitrary single qubit and controlled-single-qubit gates, as well as other specific gates like `SWAP`.

Any 2x2 bit operator matrix is represented by a list of 4 `complex` floating point numbers, in [**row-major order**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order).

Single and array "`b`" parameters represent [**Pauli operator bases**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices). They are specified according to the enumeration of the [`Pauli`](https://github.com/vm6502q/pyqrack/blob/main/pyqrack/pauli.py) class.

`MC[x]` and `MAC[x]` methods are controlled single bit gates, with as many control qubits as you specify via Python list `c` argument. `MCX` is multiply-controlled Pauli X, and `MACX` is "anti-"controlled Pauli X, i.e. "anti-control" activates the gate if all control bits are specifically **off**, as opposed to **on**.

To load the required **vm6502q/qrack** libraries from a different location, set the `PYQRACK_SHARED_LIB_PATH` environment variable.

PyQrack has experimental support for [PyZX](https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx) `Circuit` definitions as an intermediate representation for `QrackSimulator`. To try this, load a `Circuit` in PyZX, (use that module to optimize your circuit, as you like,) and create a `QrackSimulator()` instance using the `pyzxCircuit` named argument of the constructor, like so:

```python
sim = QrackSimulator(pyzxCircuit=c)
```

where `c` is a PyZX circuit object. The circuit will automatically be simulated in the constructed `QrackSimulator` instance. This also allows loading from QASM and other intermediate representations supported by PyZX.
